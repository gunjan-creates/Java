# 🔍 **Detailed Topic Breakdown**

Below is a clear and descriptive explanation of each topic covered in the repository.

---

## 🔵 **1. Collections Framework**

Contains programs demonstrating:

* List, Set, Map usage
* Iterators & enhanced for loop
* Sorting & comparators
* HashMap, TreeMap, LinkedList, ArrayList implementations

Focus: Efficient data storage & retrieval.

---

## 🔵 **2. Data Structures (DS)**

Programs covering:

* Stacks, Queues
* Linked Lists
* Searching & Sorting algorithms
* Time complexities (in comments)

Focus: Understanding underlying logic & performance.

---

## 🔵 **3. Exception Handling**

Includes:

* Exception vs Error
* JVM exception propagation
* Checked vs Unchecked exceptions
* try–catch–finally flow
* throw & throws usage
* Creating **User-Defined Exceptions**
* Nested try blocks

Focus: Making code robust, safe, and predictable.

---

## 🔵 **4. Multithreading**

Examples of:

* Extending `Thread` & implementing `Runnable`
* Thread lifecycle
* Synchronization
* Inter-thread communication
* Race conditions & thread safety

Focus: Writing concurrent & efficient Java programs.

---

## 🔵 **5. Streams API**

Modern Java data processing:

* Stream creation (Collections, Arrays)
* Intermediate operations: `filter()`, `map()`, `sorted()`
* Terminal operations: `collect()`, `forEach()`
* Working with lambdas & method references

Focus: Clean, functional-style processing of data.

---

## 🔵 **6. Strings & Exception Handling Combined**

Contains:

* String manipulation methods
* StringBuffer & StringBuilder
* Exception handling around string operations

Focus: High‑performance string handling + safe execution.

# ▶️ **How to Run the Project**

Use the `src` folder for all program execution.

### **Compile**

```
javac src/<folder>/<filename>.java
```

### **Run**

```
java <folder>.<ClassName>
```

Or use VS Code build & run shortcuts.
