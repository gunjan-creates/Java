# Collections Package - 100 Beginner Java Programs

This package contains 100 example programs demonstrating Java Collections Framework concepts.

## Topics Covered

### ArrayList (Programs 1-20)
- Basic add, remove, get, set operations
- Size, clear, isEmpty operations
- contains, indexOf, lastIndexOf
- toArray conversions
- Iteration methods
- addAll operations

### LinkedList (Programs 21-35)
- addFirst, addLast operations
- removeFirst, removeLast
- getFirst, getLast
- Queue operations: offer, poll, peek
- Deque operations

### HashSet (Programs 36-50)
- Basic add, remove operations
- contains, size, clear
- Set operations: union, intersection
- isEmpty checks

### TreeSet (Programs 51-65)
- Natural ordering
- Navigable methods: ceiling, floor, higher, lower
- Subset operations: headSet, tailSet, subSet
- Custom comparators
- Descending operations

### HashMap (Programs 66-85)
- put, get, remove operations
- containsKey, containsValue
- keySet, values, entrySet
- putAll, merge operations
- compute methods

### Other Collections (Programs 86-100)
- TreeMap operations
- LinkedHashMap
- PriorityQueue
- Stack and Vector
- Collections utility methods

## How to Run

```bash
# Compile all programs
make build

# Run a specific program (replace with actual class name)
make run CLASS=Collections.ArrayListBasicAdd
```

## Learning Path

1. Start with ArrayList basics (ArrayListBasicAdd, ArrayListRemove, etc.)
2. Move to LinkedList for understanding different list implementations
3. Learn Set implementations (HashSet, TreeSet)
4. Study Map implementations (HashMap, TreeMap)
5. Explore advanced topics and utility methods

## Tips for Beginners

- Each program is self-contained and can be run independently
- Read the comments in each file to understand the concept
- Try modifying the programs to experiment
- Compare different collection types to understand when to use each
